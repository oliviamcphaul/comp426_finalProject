# comp426_finalProject
Zodiac Dating App

For the final project of COMP 426, my team has been tasked to design and implement a fully-featured, professional web application. 

OVERVIEW

- Our team is interested in creating a web application that integrates astrology and online dating. We essentially are intending to create a program that matches individuals together based upon their zodiac compatibility. Users will be able to create an account, populate their profile with their zodiac sign and dating preferences, and be matched to other profiles that have high compatibility with their zodiac sign. 

TASKS

- Allow individuals to create dating profiles that store a password, username, age, dating preferences, brief bio, and zodiac sign.
- Successfully match accounts based on compatibility metrics
- Integrate a social-based 3rd party API
